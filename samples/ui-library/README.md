# Using UI library components

The [layout component in this sample](src/components/UILibraryComponent/UILibraryComponent.tsx) demonstrates how to use a variety of the available React components provided by the VertiGIS Studio Web React UI library. Using these React components ensures the UI behavior and styling matches the [theme configuration](https://developers.vertigisstudio.com/docs/web/configuration-theme/) of the application, including light and dark themes and custom accent colors, and [automatic translation of language strings](https://developers.vertigisstudio.com/docs/web/sdk-components-internationalization/) to the appropriate locale. These components are tested across all of our supported browsers, and are designed to be compliant with [WCAG AA accessibility guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/), which will reduce development time and help to maintain a consistent look and feel throughout the application.

To learn more about creating components using the SDK, see our documentation in the [Developer Center](https://developers.vertigisstudio.com/docs/web/sdk-components-overview/).
