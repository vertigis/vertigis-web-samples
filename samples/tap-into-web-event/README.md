# Tap into a Web event

This sample demonstrates how to tap into multiple Web events. Through custom commands we tap into the "onViewpointChanged" event in order to return to previous viewpoints. We also tap into the "onInitialized" event and use a custom command to enable opening a project at the last extent without having the user save the project.
